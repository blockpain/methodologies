auditing methodology and process


## WAYS WE CAN IMRPROVE IT

- more centralization of the toolkits, workflow (get codebase, generate callgraphs, run static analysis, get skeleton contract to see what functions exists, etc). There is no reason these things can be done in a few mouse clicks

- Data ingestion: half the job is building up team resources, keeping up with latest security news, making sure we are actively looking at everything we need to. There are tons of resources like old code4 reports, that we could parse and organize to better utilize.

- Note taking: while performing manual review, we are constantly taking notes and coming up with questions. The ability to mark up the codebase as comments and turn these into a more formal notes page would be amazing.
